#####What is the Experimental Branch?
There are 2 versions of Rust: "Legacy" and "Experimental" (also referred to as "reboot"). The legacy branch will no longer be updated because the codebase is of low quality and was limiting the progress in development. It would be too much of a hassle to repair the code and shape it into something that offered more possibilites. So the developers have decided to start off from scratch, essentially making a new Rust. The experimental branch is the result of that. Multiple updates get pushed to the experimental branch every day (see the [RustUpdates Twitter feed](https://twitter.com/RustUpdates)).

#####Is the Experimental version playable?
**Definitely**. Many people are playing it and having fun. Don't get it wrong, there is a lot still to be done. That doesn't change the fact you can run around, kill animals, make a bag (and respawn in it), make tools, harvest wood, make a house, upgrade the house, craft guns, raid other houses and kill / help anyone you come across. Shit, you can even get airdrops!

Granted, peoples definition of 'playable' can vary. For many people, this game won't be 'playable' for some time. If you're looking for a polished game, it won't be found here *yet*. Otherwise, enjoy the gorgeous landscapes, daily updates, comical glitches and crippling depression when you lose all your stuff.

#####When is the Experimental version going to become the main version?
Short answer:  
No one knows.

Slightly longer answer:  
There have been no official dates released on when Experimental will take over. The developers are working every day to reach what's being referred to as baseline. Baseline is when the functionality of the Experimental branch reaches the functionality that exists in the Legacy branch. The trello board has a specific (albeit light) list for baseline functionality needed [here](https://trello.com/b/vlKShlw3/rust-programmers). Experimental will likely become the main version around the same time baseline is met.

#####What are the new features since I left?
Please read the entirety of www.playrust.com. All the progress that has been made or will be made is stated on their website in the devblogs. It's probably **a lot**, so it's unlikely anyone will give you a summary of what's happened since you stopped playing a few months ago.

#####Are hackers still a big problem?
On the legacy branch hacking is common on servers without administrators, and is less common on servers with administrators. However, the experimental version uses [EAC](http://www.easyanticheat.net/) which should severely reduce the number of hackers going forward.

#####Why am I not allowed to report hackers on this site?
The users and moderators of /r/playrust are in no position to help you out with the issue. There won't be a magical fairy that bans hackers if you report them here. The only thing you can do is report them on steam and hope for VAC to detect the cheat they're running quickly. The Facepunch forums don't put up with naming and shaming of hackers since they won't be able to issue a VAC ban either.
