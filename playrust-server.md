# Let's talk about an official /r/playrust community server

## Prologue

Recently there have been [the odd few threads](http://www.reddit.com/r/playrust/comments/2jowh8/people_with_big_brains_needed_to_start_a_legion/) popping up around here talking about Rust servers. Trying to find a Rust server with a decent community and trustworthy admins is a tough one. It basically comes down to you the player having no idea who is maintaining the server you are connecting to (it could be someone legitimate, or maybe someone who just wanted to give themselves an advantage). Until you connect and start playing, you have no idea.

Me and the others mods started chatting about the possibility of running our own server. We feel that we run a great community here on reddit and we like to think that you guys could trust us with something like this! We've been looking for ways recently to strengthen our community and we agreed this could be a great way of bringing everyone together. We basically want to provide a safe place for everyone to play, free from hackers and abusive admins.

There are a few things we want to address before we do anything. Afterall, we're not doing this for us but for all of us as a community. So let's try and shape this server to be something awesome.

## 1.0 --- Server Advertisements -- touchy subject?

The biggest issue we came up with was advertising. As many of you know we don't allow server advertisements here (for a good reason, can you imagine how messy this place would be if we did?), so the last thing we want to do is come in here and advertise our own server whilst simulatenously silencing everyone else. We couldn't land on a good solution to this, so please throw your ideas into the pot about this one. One thing we discussed was having one initial server ad, then just a small link in the sidebar. But then do we use this subreddit as a base for discussion the server, or do we create (yet another) subreddit to house it? For me personally I'd like it if we could use /r/playrust for server discussion as well as everything else Rust-related (at least until we get bigger as a subreddit); afterall, we're trying to get a community together. Like I said, please weigh in on that!

## 2.0 --- Administration

### 2.1 -- Transparency

Something we've said from the start is that we'd like the administration to be really transparent. We want you to be able to see what we've been upto with the server, who has been banned and why, etc. This would be to cement the fact that we're not out to abuse our admin powers.

Moderation is obviously important. We'd want to keep this log as concise as possible. Between us as mods we'd probably keep some kind of log so we can all stay upto date on server drama, happenings, etc. The HARDEST part about managing a server is making sure that the moderation is kept clear, concise, and that everyone on the team is on the exact same page as how bans, kicks, and policies on the server are carried out.

### 2.2 -- Reporting

Another admin-related topic we spoke about was that it's not possible for an admin to be online 24/7. A feature we'd like to include would be a report feature, coupled with remote control of the server. We haven't looked into this yet but I don't see why it can't be done. Basically if there was someone causing trouble on the server, a player could type into the chat "!report <username> <reason>" and that would send us a message and we could address it. There's no such thing as a hacker-free server but as long as we've got something in place that means users could easily report them then we can make sure that their life on the server is a short one.

### 2.3 -- Moderators

At some point we'll probably want to employ some moderators on the server, but that's a long way off yet so *please don't ask yet*.

## 3.0 --- Other Bits

### 3.1 -- Server Config

The server would be as vanilla as we could keep it, with plugins mainly being used to improve administration.

### 3.2 -- Branding

We haven't thought of a server name yet, but it would probably be something like **Official /r/playrust community**, keep it simple. It's also important to note that this server would be our subreddit's official server, not Rust's official, nor reddit's official.

### 3.3 -- TeamSpeak and IRC

We'll probably get a Teamspeak for the server with various channels for you to join. We already have an IRC server set up, we haven't announced it yet but we will be announcing a lot of new features soon and IRC is one of them (watch this space).

### 3.4 -- Video Editors

We're keeping an eye out in the community for aspiring video editors and general 'poster people' who could help us promote the server. If that interests you then leave a comment!

## tl;dr

There isn't a tl;dr version, if you're interested you should read it all! I've put everything in headers to make your life easier.

## Still Alive?

If you're still alive after reading that, then please leave your feedback in the comments section. Like I said, we want to mould this server around the community. We'll never please everyone, and I'm sure there'll be people out there that hate the idea, but hopefully we can make this work and create something really sweet.
