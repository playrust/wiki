This is a big list of decisions we've made about the server. They're all subject to change, so let's discuss it and change them as we need to.

---

## 1. Server Location: 
* **New York (East Coast)**
  
  East Coast has a better ping for Europeans (for example I (sickboyy) am from the UK and get ~90-100ms). Eventually we'll hopefully have a dedicated EU server so we can then migrate the US server to somewhere such as Dallas. No Oceania or Asia servers yet, maybe some day since this has been requested [1][1]

  We need to chat to /u/iTruthful's friend about all of this. I think we should get the server online as soon as possible but with a generic name ('Rust Server', or whatever) so we can log in and start tinkering with it.

## 2. Server Discussion:
* **A new subreddit (/r/playrustpublic, or something)**

  No decisions made about the name yet (let's discuss that). The server will have its own dedicated subreddit, this is to reduce the noise that would be generated from the server on /r/playrust which could potentially alienate people who are only visiting for discussion about the game. [2][2]

## 3. Config:
* **Server Wipes**

  Wipes can't really be avoided at the moment since the game is being constantly updated, so it's just going to have to be an as-and-when thing, putting it off as long as we can.
  
* **Max Players**

  150? That's a random number off the top of my head.

* **Hostname**

  Official /r/playrust Community Server (US) #1
  
* **Blueprints**

  As far as I'm concerned these are part of the game now so for better or worse we should include them. Garry recently cleared things up in this area[3][3] and I think that probably put people's minds at ease.
  
## 4. Plugins / Modifications:
* **Overall Moderation Tool**

  I don't really have much experience here, but I hear a lot of good things about Oxide[4][4] so maybe we could use that. I doubt we'd be needing many of the plugins for Oxide, but it would be good to have something in place to help us keep everything in order.
  
* **Useful Plugins**

  Some things I think *would* be useful (some essential) would be: anti-cheat, chat logging, simple profanity filter (fuck, shit, etc are fine. I think we should filter out racist remarks though--thoughts?), global banning, RCON control[5][5], some kind of internal admin discussion so we could log important info (ex "!log kicked user <username> for abuse" would then be added to a log somewhere) and also that oft-talked about "!report" function.
  
  Some of these plugins I think we would need to have written for us. Are they scripted in Lua or C++? Could /u/iTruthful's friend help us out here? If not, could someone else?
  
## 5. Rules / Conduct

  I don't think we need that many rules, but the ones we do have should be really obviously broken. So:
  
  1. No Hacking
  2. No Spamming
  3. No Flaming
 
  The grey-areas here are things like 'no exploiting' as it's going to be really difficult to spot/prove and will probably just result in a lot of finger pointing.

Please edit this document as you see fit. I decided to use GitHub for this because we can easily see previous versions to see how the rules have progressed.
